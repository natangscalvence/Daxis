# Daxis — A Language for who that prefer the easy, but functional way.

**Daxis** is a **multi-paradigm**, **modern**, and **low-level** programming language that blends the **efficiency of C** with the **clarity of modern languages**.  
Designed to be **elegant**, **performant**, and **easy to learn**, Daxis unifies imperative, object-oriented, and functional paradigms under one coherent system.

---

## Philosophy

> “Simplicity without losing power. Control without losing clarity.”

Daxis was born from the desire to understand computing at its core — without sacrificing productivity.  
Every design decision balances **low-level control** with **expressive power**.

---

## Paradigms

###  Imperative / Procedural

Built on C’s foundations, Daxis provides full control over flow, memory, and structures.  
Use familiar constructs like `if`, `while`, and function calls with native-level performance.

###  Object-Oriented

Classes are built upon `struct`s, with **internal methods**, **simulated inheritance**, and a **vtable system** for polymorphism.  
Object creation can be **manual** (like `malloc`) or **automatic** via an optional **garbage collector**.

###  Functional

Functions are **first-class citizens**.  
Immutability and pure expressions are encouraged for safer, more predictable code.

---

##  Native Parallelism

Daxis integrates **concurrency** directly into the language.  
Inspired by Go and Erlang, its model blends **threads** and **actors** seamlessly.

```daxis
go long_task()
channel := make_channel()
channel.send(data)
```
## Native Parallelism

- **Native primitives:** channels, mutexes, semaphores  
- **Built-in scheduler:** lightweight, message-driven concurrency

---

## Easy-to-Learn Syntax

No semicolons. No verbosity.  
Just **clarity, focus, and speed**.

---

## Native Libraries

Daxis ships with a set of core libraries implemented in C:

- **HTTP** — Built-in client and server, with HTTPS support  
- **File I/O** — Easy file and directory manipulation  
- **Collections** — Dynamic arrays, hash maps, and sets  
- **Strings** — Fully Unicode-compatible  
- **Math** — Complete mathematical function library

> Libraries expose clean, idiomatic Daxis APIs while maintaining C-level performance.
